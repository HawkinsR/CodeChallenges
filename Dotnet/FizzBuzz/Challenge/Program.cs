    FizzBuzz - The frustratingly common FizzBuzz game. The player selects a range of numbers (2 - 18) 
        and the computer plays FizzBuzz. It prints the number on it's own line in the output.
        - If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz". 
        - If the number is divisible by 5, replace with "Buzz". 
        - If the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5, replace with with "FizzBuzz".
    *Challenge:* Add "Bang" for numbers divisible by 7, and all the combinations of 3, 5, and 7 get the
        combinations of Fizz, Buzz, Bang.
    *Challenge:* Alternate between the computer and user input to complete the game. The computer starts,
        printing "2". The player has to continue, either entering the word "Fizz", or selecting an option from a list.
        Include a factor of randomization, so that a player can choose how dificult the computer is to beat by modifying
        how random its answer will be.
