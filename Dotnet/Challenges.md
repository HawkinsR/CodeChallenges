1. Hot or Cold - The classic "hot or cold" game, but with numbers. The computer generates a random number, and the player has to make guesses until they correctly guess the random number. The computer can only tell the play if they guessed too high, too low, or correctly.
    *Challenge:* Allow the player to select the possible number range (ie. 0 - 20, 3 - 9, 30 - 100) to choose their own difficulty.

2. FizzBuzz - The frustratingly common FizzBuzz game. The player selects a range of numbers (2 - 18) and the computer plays FizzBuzz. It prints the number on it's own line in the output. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, replace with with "Buzz". If the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5, replace with with "FizzBuzz".
    *Challenge:* Add "Bang" for numbers divisible by 7, and all the combinations of 3, 5, and 7 get the combinations of Fizz, Buzz, Bang.
    *Challenge:* Alternate between the computer and user input to complete the game. The computer starts, printing "2". The play has to continue, either entering the word "Fizz", or selecting an option from a list.

3. Hangman - Play a game of hangman with the computer. A "random" word is chosen, and the number of letters is displayed. The player has to guess letters, which are revealed in the word if correct. Incorrect guessed can be counted, or used as a countdown against the player.
    *Challenge:* Use formatting in the console display to "update" the display without moving down the terminal output. Keep the hidden word, previously guessed letters, and the players input in fixed locations on screen.

4. Rock, Paper, Scissors - Play a game of RPS with the computer. Each round, the computer randomly chooses a "throw", and compares to the selection made by the user.
    *Challenge:* Keep a win/loss record for the player to track their overall record.
